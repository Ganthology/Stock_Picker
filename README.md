# Stock Picker
This is a small project from The Odin project, the project is to build a stocker picker using Ruby language. There is an array keeping the price of stock everyday, and the stock cannot be sold before buying it. The stock picker will compute the largest profit and suggest a date to buy and sell the stock.
## Small Summary
There are three variables used in this program: current_min, min_index and max_index. The program always compare the profit generated by min max and the profit by current stock and current min. If current profit is larger, then the max_index is updated as current stock and min_index is updated as current min.
